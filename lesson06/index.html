    <p>Hi! My name is Ethan.
         I am 7 years old. My family has 4 members: my father, my mother, my younger sister and me. My father is an engineer. He is 40 years old. Currently, he works in the factory near my house so he doesn’t have to go so far to work. And my mother is 37 years old now. She is a literature teacher at Amsterdam high school, it’s also the old school where she studied a few years ago. Her students love her so much because she is a kind teacher. My younger sister is named Lisa. She is 2 years old, she is just a baby. Everyone in my family loves her very much because she is very lovely and obedient. She is very cute and I always take care of her whenever I finish my homework</p>
